The dashes in a dashed bar line covers staff lines exactly. Dashed
barlines between staves start and end on a half dash precisely.

The dots in a dotted bar line are in spaces.

A thick bar line is created by \bar \".\", which is consistent
with e.g. \bar \"|.\"

A ticked bar line is a short line of the same length as a staff
space, centered on the top-most barline.
